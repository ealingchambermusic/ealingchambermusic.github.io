### Directions and Map

The church is close to Western Avenue (A40), near the Hoover building, but on the opposite side of 
the road, and there is direct access from the A40 to Perivale Lane only for pedestrians and cyclists. 
The church is situated at the end of Perivale Lane, (turn left at traffic lights off Argyle Road 
if you are coming from the A40), on the right hand side of the road, opposite the back of the 
Mylett Arms, about 70 yards down a cycle path. There is ample free parking on Perivale Lane, and 
virtually no parking restrictions. The church is a 10 minute walk from Perivale tube station 
(on the Central line), via a footbridge over Western Avenue. Bus routes to the church include 
number 95 (along Western Avenue), and 297 and E5 (along Argyle Road).
