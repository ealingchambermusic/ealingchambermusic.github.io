We always welcome new members. You might want to come along to one of 
the monthly meetings to see what it's all about.  See the [Events](/events) 
page to find out when the next meeting will be.i  

If you do decide to join, please complete the [membership application form](/assets/membership-application-form.doc). 
The annual subscription fee, which covers the cost of our venue for events, 
is currently Â£15.  

Once you've joined, we'll add you to our list of members. This allows you 
to see who's in the club, what they play, and where they live. It's up to 
members to put together groups for things they want to play, but a committee 
member will be able to help if you don't know anyone yet and put you in touch 
with other players with similar interest and abilities. You will also receive 
our monthly newsletter with the concert programme and programme notes to 
download and print for yourself, and the catalogue of the [Anthea Sharma 
Chamber music collection](/music-library/).  

If you would like further information about joining ECMC, please
