For ideas of what to play, take a look at the [Events](/events) page and the archive 
section, which will give you an idea of the wide range of music that has been presented 
during the Club’s first eleven years. You may find one of the following books helpful:

[“Chamber music repertoire for Amateur Players; a guide to choosing works matching 
  players’ abilities” 3rd ed. By Harold Haynes. ISBN 0 9524572 2 9.](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Chamber-Music-Repertoire-Amateur-Players/dp/0952457229)  

It is very much focussed on strings, but also has sections on strings with piano and strings with wind.

There is one for wind players:

[An Annotated Guide to Wind Chamber Music: Paperback Edition (Donald Hunsberger Wind Library) by Rodney Winther, 2004](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Annotated-Guide-Wind-Chamber-Music-ebook/dp/B004HIMXXI/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1438726704&sr=1-1&keywords=An+Annotated+Guide+to+Wind+Chamber+Music%3A+Paperback+Edition+%28Donald+Hunsberger+Wind+Library%29+by+Rodney+Winther%2C+2004)

[The ultimate woodwind chamber music repertoire list](http://woodwindchambermusicrepertoire.weebly.com/) includes every possible combo e.g. saxophone, violin & piano. Gives timings and whether parts are in [IMSLP](http://imslp.org/), but no guidance on difficulty.
