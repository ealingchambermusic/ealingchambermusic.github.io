title: July - Last concert of the season
---
We will round off the season on Monday 11 th July. The concert is organised by Liz Sharma,
who now has a full programme for the evening. As you probably know by now, the second
half will feature a Singalong _“Les Miserables”_ and Liz will be happy to welcome more string
players and guest singers. Just let her know a.s.a.p. and she will send a copy of your part in
advance.
