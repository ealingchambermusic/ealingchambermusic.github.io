title: Our new Membership Secretary

### Big thanks to John Heffernan for volunteering! 

John has agreed to take over the job of Membership Secretary from Hilary. He'll keep the 
membership list up to date and deal with new applications. He'll also send over the heavies when members don't pay their subscriptions.
Hilary will still keep on putting together the programmes and her excellent programme notes.

Thanks to Hilary for doing it for so long, and thanks to John for taking it over now! 
Members really appreciate the time you and the other committee members take to keep the club running.
