title: July 2016 Concert
------------------------
Please come to the final concert of the season on July 11th, which 
will of course feaure the _LES MISERABLES_ Singalong.

The first half of the programme will be mainly for voice and flute, 
starting with two items from Handel’s ‘9 German Arias’, composed 1724-6. 
These are *“Süße Stille, sanfte Quelle”*, HWV 205, and *“Flammende Rose, Zierde der Erden”*, HWV 210. 
The pieces, originally composed for violin obbligato, are set to the 
poetry of the 18th century German poet, Barthold Brockes. Each aria 
contains elements of praising God through nature, from the flaming 
rose of No. 9 to the rushing rivers of No. 2. The performers are Geneviève 
Usher (soprano), Lowri Norris (flute), Helen Thomas (cello),and 
John Heffernan (harpsichord).
They continue with  “Hark Tis the Lark”, by James Hook (1746 - 1827). 
A child prodigy at the keyboard, he played harpsichord from age of 
four and performed concertos from the age of six; by February 1764 he 
was working as an organist at one of the many tea gardens that abounded 
in 18th Century London. He made a name for himself as a composer of
light, attractive music, including over 2,000 songs -  
(“The lass of Richmond Hill” was one of these.) 
Hook's songs were regularly performed at the main London pleasure 
gardens, and he served as resident composer at Vauxhall for over 
half a century. Apart from his treatise, *“Guida di musica”* (1785-94), 
little of his vast output was published, but we do have “The Aviary, a 
Collection of 6 Sonnets” published in about 1783, from which this song is taken.
 
After this, Theresa Cory & Alison Jewsbury (flutes) play Andante & 
Rondo by Doppler Op.25, with David Smith at the piano.
Albert Franz Doppler (16 October 1821 – 27 July 1883), was a flute 
virtuoso and a composer best known for his flute music. He also wrote 
one German and several Hungarian operas for Budapest, all produced with 
great success. His ballet music was popular during his lifetime. 
Doppler was born in Poland in Lviv, now in Ukraine. He formed a 
flute duo with his brother Karl, four years younger, who mainly wrote 
songs and incidental music, and as a duo they caused quite a sensation 
throughout Europe, helping to found the Hungarian Philharmonic Orchestra 
in 1853. Doppler became chief conductor, of the Vienna Court Opera, as 
well as Professor of Flute at the Vienna Conservatoire. By the way, as 
far as I can tell there is no connection between the composer and the 
Austrian physicist Christian Doppler, who proposed the “Doppler Effect” 
in 1842 in Prague.
 
The second half of the programme will be the Les Mis Singalong. 
*_LES MISERABLES_* is based on Victor Hugo’s original novel,  
composed by Claude-Michel Schönberg (b.1944) in collaboration with 
lyricists Alain Boublil & Jean-Marc Natel – (English lyrics Herbert Kretzmer) - 
and specially orchestrated for the evening by Liz Sharma. Do invite any 
friends and relations to come along, and please email Liz Sharma at lizsharma@aol.com
