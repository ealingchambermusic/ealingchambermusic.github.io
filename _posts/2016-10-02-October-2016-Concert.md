Our next concert will be on Monday 10th October. First we have four 
Schubert songs presented by Jo Parton (mezzo soprano) and Nick Reading 
(piano); these are 

1. _Die Jünge Nonne_ (The young nun), from a poem by Jakob Nikolaus von Craigher da Jachelutta, 1797-1855 – 
  the name in the website is even longer, but enough is enough. This was written towards the end of Schubert’s short life.
2. _Irrlicht_ (Will o’ the Wisp), with text by Wilhelm Muller,1794 – 1827.    
3. _Der Zwerg_ (The Dwarf), with text by Matthaus Casimir von Collin,1779 – 1824, a leading Viennese poet of the day, and
4. _Der Leiermann_ (The Hurdy-Gurdy man), with text by Muller.

Both the Muller songs are from _Winterreise_.
Hopefully, the singer will tell us more about these songs.
 
Secondly, Li Lin Teo will perform the first movement of Rachmaninov’s 
second Piano Concerto, accompanied on the digital piano by Lewis Lev. 
This great work needs little introduction. It was premiered,  with the 
composer as soloist, on 9 November 1901, with his cousin Alexander 
Siloti conducting. This is one of Rachmaninoff's most enduringly
popular works, and established his fame as a concerto composer. 
Famously, this work confirmed his recovery from clinical depression 
and writer's block, cured only by a course of hypnotherapy. As a result,
the concerto was dedicated to Nikolai Dahl, the physician who had done
much to restore Rachmaninoff's self-confidence
