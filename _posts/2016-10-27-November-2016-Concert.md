Firstly, the *Milhaud Suite for violin, clarinet and piano Op.157b*
performed by John Martin, Theresa Cory and David Smith. 
The four movements are _Ouverture_, _Divertissement_, _Jeu_ 
and _Introduction et Final_. 

Milhaud (1892-1974) was a member of _Les Six_, which included 
Honegger and the Widor of the famous toccata -— and one of the most 
prolific composers of the 20th century. His compositions are 
influenced by jazz and Latin American music and make use of 
polytonality. As a Jew, he had to leave France during WW2, and got 
a teaching post in USA, where It’s striking that his pupils 
included Dave Brubeck and Burt Bacharach.
 
Secondly, the Rupert Bawden and Chris Crocker viola and piano duo 
will introduce us to a sonata by a composer that probably none 
of us had heard of before, so I will give it somewhat more 
space than usual. *Rebecca Clarke*, (1886 – 1979) was a composer best 
known for her works featuring the viola. She was born in Harrow and 
studied at the RAM, but was withdrawn by her father in 1905 after 
her teacher Percy Miles proposed to her (he later left her a 
Stradivarius violin in his will). Afterwards she studied viola 
and composition at the RCM in London, but following her criticism of 
his extra-marital affairs, her father turned her out of the house and 
cut off her funds. She had to leave the College in 1910 and supported
herself through her viola playing, becoming one of the first female 
professional orchestral players. Stranded in the United States 
at the outbreak of World War II, she settled permanently in New York 
City, where she died at the age of 93.
 
Although Clarke wrote little, her work was recognised for its 
compositional skill. A short, lyrical piece for viola and piano 
entitled Morpheus, composed under the pseudonym of "Anthony Trent", 
was premiered at a recital in 1918. Reviewers praised the "Trent", 
largely ignoring the works under her own name premiered in the same 
recital. After she stopped composing she was largely forgotten, and 
interest only revived in 1976.
 
The viola sonata is probably the most significant chamber work by a 
woman composer in the first half of the last century. It was submitted 
in 1919 to a composition competition sponsored by her neighbor, 
Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge, a very notable supporter of contemporary
music. She was denied the prize because it might look like favouritism 
on Coolidge’s part.
 
Naturally, it was also suspected by some that the name "Rebecca Clarke"
was a pen-name of a male composer, as few imagined the possibility of 
a competent female writing such music. (But then, why on earth would a 
male composer take on such a handicap? – a daft suggestion).
