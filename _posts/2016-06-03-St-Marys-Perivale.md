## St Mary's Perivale
As you know, we are indebted to the Friends of St Mary’s, who let us book this lovely church
regularly at very reasonable rates and throw in free rehearsals whenever we want them, as
well as including a summary of our next concert in their mailouts.

Hugh Mather has asked me to include in a summary of forthcoming Friends
concerts, which I've done below. But I wonder if ECMC members would
be willing to go onto the Friends’ emailing list if they aren’t already on it? 
I do urge you to go to the [Friends of St Mary website](http://www.st-marys-perivale.org.uk/friends-001.shtml) and
sign up, even if you think you may never go to one of their concerts. They are of course professional and very good indeed.
