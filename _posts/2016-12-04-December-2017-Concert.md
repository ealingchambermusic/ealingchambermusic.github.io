title: December concert and all-comers play-in
---
As we wind up 2016, first please note that the AGM Minutes from last month are 
[here](/assets/AGM-Minutes-2016.pdf), 

Here are the details for the Christmas concert and Play-in on Monday 12th December. 
The programme is available for download [here](/assets/programmes/Programme_16.12.pdf).
 Please print your own programme, as any that I print are intended for visitors.
    
    
We begin with a Cradle song by Liz Sharma, sung by soprano Genevieve Usher, 
with Chris Crocker on piano and Liz on recorder. This began life as a choral 
piece and was first performed seven years ago.
 
On this occasion we will have some guest singers. The Voice Section is a small 
choir who are almost all members of the Ealing Symphony Orchestra and  
several of whom are also members of ECMC. The group was originally formed 
to participate with other choirs in a Remembrance Day concert in Worthing 
last year, and continued because we all enjoyed it. This will be our second 
appearance at St. Mary’s, and the programme will include:

* _‘O magnum mysterium’_ by Byrd
* _‘Hodie Christus natus est’_ by Poulenc 
* _‘The Lamb’_ by John Tavener – a setting of Blake’s poem.
* _‘Have yourself a merry little Christmas’_ by Ralph Blane, Lyrics by Hugh Martin,         
  originally written for the film musical _“Meet me in St Louis.”_ (1944)

The singers are:

* Sopranos: Emily, Griggs, Helena Gumley-Mason, Joey Innes-Hopkins and Hilary Potts,
* Altos: Angela Hailstone, Heather Humphries and Alice Laddiman
* Tenors: Patrick Grattan and John Martin
* Basses: Paul Darling, Adrian Hailstone, Martyn Humphreys, Graham Ritchie and Steve Warrington
 
To complete the recital section of the concert is a piano piece called 
_“Furry Lisa”_ performed by Rainer Hersch – NOT the one on YouTube by George 
Schneider, but actually the very first outing anywhere - one is loath to use 
the expression ‘world premiere’ because that sounds far too grand - of a 
piece by a friend of Rainer’s, Steven Baker, written for him and his 
orchestra to play.  Rainer says, “Steven is a general musical whizz and 
does a lot of my arrangements these days.  It can also be played solo, 
which is what I am doing, though I am also bringing Cliff Bradley to 
add a bit of body on bass guitar.  It is based, of course, on the famous 
bagatelle by Beethoven.”  
 
### All-comers PLAY-IN.

Please all bring your instruments. We will play Purcell's beautiful _'Chaconne'_, 
arranged as a little concerto grosso, with recorder trio, only one of a number of 
arrangements of it which Liz has made.

Then, _'Ancient Stories'_ a short piece by Liz Sharma, This is part of a larger 
_'Memories & Myths'_,originally written for large ensemble at a wind course in 
France. This will be the first performance of the chamber orchestra version.

Finally, _'Green Christmas'_ - a medley of carols on the subject of foliage - 
some well known, some totally obscure.

Hopefully, the social will include some eats to go with the wine.
 
Our next concert will be on January 9th and is organised by Andrew Lewandowski, 
who is hoping for more items than he has at present.
 
It only remains to wish all our members and friends a happy Christmas and 
prosperous New Year.
