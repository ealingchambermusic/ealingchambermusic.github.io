## ECMC Outreach Projects

Almost since the club was founded ECMC members have volunteered their time 
to form an orchestra and go into Primary schools to perform my specially 
composed musical stories with hundreds of children at a time. All the children 
in the school learn songs, (some in three part counterpoint), recorder & 
percussion pieces, provide the narration, and create  art work, etc. and 
experience the thrill of performing as equal partners with an adult orchestra.

The adult musicians have one rehearsal before the event, and usually spend a 
whole day in the school, to allow for two performances of the work, with a 
nice lunch in between. The excitement which builds amongst the children 
in the term leading up to one of these events is a joyful experience for 
the staff as well as the adult musicians. The children take responsibility 
for their part of the whole performance, learning to count  their rests, 
come  in at the right time, move at the right time, and create the art work.  

Over the years ECMC members have enabled thousands of children in four 
different schools to hear and see orchestral instruments, and to realise by 
watching the musicians, that music is a lifelong pleasure.  

The stories performed in four schools over the years are:

* _Wind Dragon_ about a music loving dragon who helps the children care 
  for the environment,
* _Wind Dragon 2, the Sequel_ in which MP Stephen Pound accepted a cameo role
* _Rainbow Island_ - about villagers working together for the good of all, 
  on a remote island
* _Zoo Tales_ - About clever, and musical animals who hold a party after the 
  Zoo is closed for the night
* _Dave the Musical Caveman_ about the formation of the very first orchestra, 
  when people first had to invent their instruments before they could participate.  

Thousands of children & I are very grateful to the increasing number of members 
who volunteer for these events every year, in fact some people have played in 
every single one.
