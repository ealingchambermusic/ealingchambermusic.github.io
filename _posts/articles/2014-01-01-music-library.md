![Anthea Sharma, a club member who has passed away, donated here music library to us](/images/anthea-sharma.jpg)

ECMC members are welcome to borrow music from our new Anthea Sharma 
Chamber Music library. The catalogue is [here](/assets/composer-list-anthea-sharma-collection.xls)

By clicking onto the Box column and a/z, you should be able to convert it to whatever category of music is most relevant to you.

If you want to borrow something, apply to the guardian of that particular box. Almost all the music is in good, mostly excellent, condition, and cries out to be borrowed – though not for so long that you forget it isn’t yours.
