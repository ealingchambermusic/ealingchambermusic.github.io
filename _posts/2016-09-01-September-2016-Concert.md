Our concert on 12th September will start with a set of flute duets by 
C.P.E. Bach (1714-88), played on the recorder. They may have been 
written for Frederick the Great. This Bach had  a higher status at 
court than the previous generation, as Johann Sebastian sent all his 
sons to Leipzig University. C.P.E. came away with a law degree but of 
course went straight into his musical career as intended, being already 
a virtuoso keyboard player, but with his degree he was now a gentleman 
rather than a servant. The set of ten short pieces may have been modelled 
on a rather similar set of six by Telemann, Carl Philippe’s godfather 
and a strong influence. Liz Sharma and Hilary Potts have selected five 
which fall within recorder range, although not without a change of 
instruments for the second player and a little adjustment of octaves for 
both players here and there, as per normal for recorder players. 
These are: Allemande, Polacca, Scherzo, Air & Gigue.
 
Following this, the Lyrica Quartet: _Jill Davis, Julia Harris (violins), 
Ceri Fagg (viola), and Peter Mazug (cello)_ presents three of Elgar’s 
 best-known and most charming works, the Chanson de Matin, Chanson de 
 Nuit and Salut D'Amour, all originally composed for violin in the late 
 1880’s, and arranged for string quartet by the composer.
 
After this, a big contrast. Andrew Lewandowski plays Three Pieces 
for clarinet (In A) solo by Lennox Berkeley. Written in 1939, these are 
marked Moderato, Lento and Allegro.  Thea King, the dedicatee, probably 
premiered the work; she edited it for publication. One reviewer comments: 
_"What marks these pieces are the concise, clear lines, uncomplicated 
structure, and a shifting or compound use of both tonality and meter. 
These elements create music that is easy to listen to and appreciate, 
but with such a complexity of moods that it is often hard to describe 
a piece or movement as having just one overarching emotion.
The Three Pieces for Clarinet Solo are not traditionally tonal or tuneful, 
sounding like the prose of a person's inner voice."_
 
Finally, the Lyrica Quartet return with a selection of Gershwin
numbers – “The Man I Love”, “Someone to Watch Over Me” and “Swanee”. 
These were composed for Broadway shows in 1924, 1926 and 1919 respectively,
and have been revived and rearranged many times over.
We’re grateful for the Quartet for coming up with these items at short 
notice when their original plans had to be dropped through illness.
