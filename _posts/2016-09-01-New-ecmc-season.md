title: New ECMC season starts 12th September
------
Welcome to the start of the Club’s 13th season and its 120th concert. This is a proud record.

Before giving you the details for 12th September, I’d like to refresh your memory on the 
Guidelines for performers. The Committee has agreed on the following:
 
“We welcome, and encourage performances from as many members as possible, 
but you are under no obligation to perform, if you prefer to just 
meet other members and play music for the pleasure of it.
 
If you wish to perform in one of our monthly concerts, you need to 
rehearse first, & when your performance is secure, only then request a
slot with whoever is organising the appropriate concert. In the usual way, 
items should be 20mins or less, but longer, complete works can be
performed in exceptional circumstances, with the agreement of the committee.
 
We prefer items to involve three or more performers, but we welcome duos,
as long as both performers play an equal part. At last year's AGM it was 
agreed that pianists who have not performed for us before would be 
welcome to offer a solo slot (not a recital) to introduce themselves 
to other members, and this invitation also applies to other instrumentalists. 
The concert organiser is the person who has the responsibility to apply 
the approach and may refer to the committee to check any items or 
changes which occasionally sit outside these guidelines. This is 
especially relevant if the concert organiser himself intends to step 
outside these guidelines.
 
If you are considering offering to perform, especially if you are not a 
seasoned performer, it is not necessary to choose a long piece, or the
most difficult you can find. This will make you unduly nervous, & 
the audience will feel uncomfortable. Far better to choose something 
shorter and at a level of difficulty that you can perform  expressively & well, 
then we will all enjoy the experience. When choosing what to perform, 
you are strongly recommended to seek the advice of a Committee member 
(or, failing that, someone who has performed regularly), and then
take that advice - bearing in mind that nerves may make one perform 
at only 90% of one's normal level, if that. It may also be better to
consider playing as part of an ensemble with other members, especially
if you have a particular work in mind that you would like to play. 
Committee members will be only too happy help you find other musicians 
with whom to perform, if you need advice.
 
Finally, at the December & July meetings we have our all members play -ins, 
in which we hope you will participate. These events are a chance for us
all to celebrate making music together, just for the joy of it. 
However, you do need to email Liz Sharma (lizsharma@aol.com) to let 
her know you want to play, and she will ensure there is a part for you, 
& send it as a pdf file, so that you can print & practise beforehand.
 
Happy Music Making , & the committee hope you will enjoy the new season.
