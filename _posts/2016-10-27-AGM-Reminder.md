title: AGM Reminder
-------------------
The AGM has come round again, and will be at the end of the
 [14th November concert](/2016/10/27/November-2016-Concert.html). 

The agenda is available [here](/assets/a.g.n-agenda-2016.pdf).

I'll attach the minutes from 2015 to this month's newsletter. 
If you are coming, please print your own, as I am finding it too heavy on 
printer ink to make multiple copies. 

Please do consider whether you would like to join the Committee, 
which these days does almost all its work via email. 

Our website manager, Toby Louw, would be happy to resign if there 
is anyone interested in taking over his role. 

Whether you are this person or not, 
do look at the website and bring any comments or ideas for improvement â€“ 
and of course, any others about the running of the Club generally.
