title: COMPOSERS’ FORUM CONCERTS
--------------------------------
*A message from Liz Sharma*

Welcome to the new ECMC season. We started with a lovely concert on Monday 12th, 
& at the time I outlined a potential plan & a request. The committee of London 
Composers' Forum, of which I'm a member, want to make a list of instrumentalists 
& singers who would be willing to perform at London Composers' Forum concerts.

We are trying to hold more concerts per year than previously, in venues such 
as the Holst room at Morley college, the performance space below Schotts near
Regent street & various other fairly central venues. Most of the concerts feature 
chamber ensembles, but our concert organiser also hopes to form an orchestra, which 
would rehearse a couple of times before a performance. 

The list of willing players would be held only by committee members, and 
would not be passed on to anyone else, and of course placing your name on the 
list does not commit you to playing any piece of music, or at any performance 
with which you are not comfortable. It merely indicates your willingness to be 
invited to perform. If you are willing to add your name to the list please 
let me know.

Hope to see you at the next meeting.

Best wishes, Liz
